Sparks Website
==============

Hi there! This repository holds the Sparks website, a new initiative by
Stanford students, to encourage project building among Stanford students and
reduce the barriers to actually get out there and build something.  Through
a mix of events, programs, and products, e.g. workshops to teach students how
to build websites or connecting similarly-interested students together to build
projects, we aim to provide that spark to get in the mindset of construction
rather than just discussion.
